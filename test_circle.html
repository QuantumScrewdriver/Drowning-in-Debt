            <p class="help-body"><a class="help-body-link" href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002716217696041" target="_blank">Studies</a>have shown that prospective students of higher education, particularly in lower-income households, are more likely to have debt-averse attitudes and, as a result, are more likely to be deterred from going to college. This attitude has increased rather than decreased in the past decades, reflecting the deepening nature of this crisis.</p>
